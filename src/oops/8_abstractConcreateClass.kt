//Abstract class: incomplete class i.e. its methods may have nobody
//An abstract class is a class that is declared abstractâ€”it may or may not include abstract methods.
// Abstract classes (or object of abstract class) cannot be instantiated directly, but they can be subclassed.
// An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation in abstract class (without braces, and followed by a semicolon)
//When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all the abstract methods in its parent class
